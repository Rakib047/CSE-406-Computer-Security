The following is the partition layout of the disk image. A tool should show all six FAT16 partitions. Each partition has a file in it whose name corresponds to the partition. Each file has zero size. In the Extended DOS Partition Test, a disk image was modified to create a third entry in the extended partition, which is not typically possible using standard partitioning tools. This new entry was labeled "vol14" and was a DOS FAT16 partition that spanned sectors 262,143 to 312,479.
