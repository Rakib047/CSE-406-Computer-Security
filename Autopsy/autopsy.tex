\section{Creating a Case and Analysis}

Launching Autopsy will display options to create a new case or open an existing case. To create a new case, click on the New Case button. Add a case name and a base directory for the case.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{newCaseInfo.PNG}
\end{center}

Additionally, we can add a Case type: Single User or Multi User. Multi User cases are used when multiple users are working on the same case.

Then we will be prompted to add additional information about the case shown below:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{additionalInfo.PNG}
\end{center}

All fields on this panel are optional. Additionally, the Organization section will only be active if the central repository is enabled.

After creating the case, we will be prompted to add a data source shown below:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{addDataSource.PNG}
\end{center}

We need to select the host for the data source. There are three options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate new host based on data source name - this will typically create a host with a name similar to our data source with the ID used in the database appended for uniqueness.
    \item Specify new host name - this will allow us to create a new host with a custom name.
    \item Use existing host - this will allow us to select an existing host from the database.
\end{itemize}

After selecting the host, we need to select the data source type.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{selectDataSourceType.PNG}
\end{center}

Next we will be prompted to select the data source file. 

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{selectDataSourceFile.PNG}
\end{center}

After selecting the data source file, we will be prompted to configure the Ingest Modules:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{configureIngestModule.PNG}
\end{center}

Then we need to wait while Autopsy performs a basic examination of the data source and populates an embedded database with an entry for each file in the data source.
After the basic examination of the data source is complete, the ingest modules will likely still be running but we can start browsing through the files in our data source.

\section{Examination utilizing Ingest Modules}

\subsection{Recent Activity}
The Recent Activity module in Autopsy gathers user engagement data from web browsers, installed programs, and the operating system, providing insights into online searches, visited websites, system actions, and connections made.

\end{center}

\subsection{Picture Analyzer}
The Picture Analyzer module in Autopsy retrieves important information from images, such as location, date, time, camera model, and settings, known as EXIF metadata. This data is then added to the Blackboard for further analysis, providing insights into the photograph's details like where and when it was taken, and what camera was used. Additionally, the module converts HEIC/HEIF photos to JPG format while keeping their EXIF data intact, ensuring they are treated and saved just like regular JPG images.

\subsubsection*{Results}
The outcomes are displayed in the result trees.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{3/3.6/Picture Analyzer Results.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Keyword Search}
The Keyword Search module enables searching during the ingest process and also supports manual text searches post-ingest (refer to Ad Hoc Keyword Search). It extracts text from ingested files, selected reports generated by other modules, and results from other modules. Users can specify keywords to search for, add regular expressions for searching, and include keywords to exclude from the search.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{3/3.7/Keyword Search Settings.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Results}
In the global settings options, users can incorporate custom keyword rules for searching. When this module is executed, it searches for specified keywords within files and their metadata. The search results are displayed in \texttt{Analysis Results > Keyword Hits}, grouped together by the detected keyword.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{3/3.7/Keyword Search Results Details.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Interesting Files Identifier}
The Interesting Files Identifier module automatically flags files and directories that adhere to predefined criteria. This feature proves beneficial for verifying the presence of files with specific names or paths within the data source, or when files of particular types consistently warrant attention.

\subsubsection*{Configuring Interesting Files Settings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users can define a set of rules by accessing the \texttt{Tools > Options > Interesting Files} dialog box.
    \item For instance, in our demonstration, we established a rule set named "Suspicious."
    \item Within this set, we incorporated two specific rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If any file contains the substring "Worm" in its name, it will be categorized as an "interesting file."
        \item Similarly, if any file contains the substring "virus" in its name, it will also be categorized as an "interesting file."
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{3/3.8/Interesting Files Configuration.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Results}
After running the "Interesting Files Identifier" ingest module, the results can be viewed in \texttt{Analysis Results > Interesting Items}. Three files have been identified as interesting items due to their names containing the substrings "worm" or "virus," as defined within the "Suspicious" set of rules.

\subsection{Email Parser}
The Email Parser module recognizes MBOX, EML, and PST format files by their signatures. It extracts emails from these files and adds the results to the Blackboard. Additionally, it identifies the email accounts used in the discovered emails.

\subsection{NTFS Autodetect Test}
\subsubsection*{Introduction}
This test includes four images. One image is a disk image comprising two partitions, with each partition also provided as an individual file. The fourth image is an additional partition image. The objective of this test case is to evaluate the file system detection capabilities of analysis tools. While a typical partition usually contains only one file system, certain file system layouts allow for multiple file systems within a single partition. In this scenario, each partition within the disk image contains two file systems. Specifically, the first partition is formatted for NTFS and Ext2, the second for NTFS and UFS2, and the third for NTFS and UFS1. Both file systems are legitimate and can be mounted within their respective operating systems. The test aims to determine whether a tool will correctly identify the presence of two valid file systems or if it will only display one while concealing the other.

\subsubsection*{Image Details}

The disk image \texttt{10-ntfs-disk.dd} contains a DOS partition table with two partitions: \texttt{10-ntfs-part1.dd} and \texttt{10-ntfs-part2.dd}. Both partitions have a type of 0x07, indicating NTFS file systems. Let's explore the contents of each partition:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{10-ntfs-part1.dd}: Originating from the first partition within \texttt{10-ntfs-disk.dd}, this image was initially formatted as NTFS using Windows XP, housing the \texttt{ntfs.txt} file. Subsequently, the partition was formatted as Ext2, resulting in the creation of the \texttt{ext2.txt} file. Windows error-checking detected no issues with the NTFS file system.
    
    \item \texttt{10-ntfs-part2.dd}: Derived from the second partition of \texttt{10-ntfs-disk.dd}, this image was initially formatted as NTFS within Windows XP, containing the \texttt{ntfs.txt} file. However, a subsequent formatting process converted it to UFS2, inadvertently creating the \texttt{ufs1.txt} file. Despite the misformatting, Windows error-checking detected no issues. Notably, this partition was intended to be UFS1 but was erroneously formatted as FreeBSD UFS2.
    
    \item Additionally, the image \texttt{10-ntfs-part3.dd} does not reside within \texttt{10-ntfs-disk.dd} but was created due to the incorrect formatting of \texttt{10-ntfs-part2.dd} as UFS2 instead of UFS1. Initially formatted as NTFS using Windows XP, this partition contains the \texttt{ntfs.txt} file. Subsequent formatting transformed it into UFS1, resulting in the creation of the \texttt{ufs1.txt} file. Once again, Windows error-checking reported no issues with the NTFS file system.
\end{itemize}

This series of events underscores the complexity and potential errors inherent in partition formatting, while also showcasing the resilience of NTFS file systems under scrutiny.
